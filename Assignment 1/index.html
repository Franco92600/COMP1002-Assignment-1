                we haven't covered it in class, and I'm not sure if I am right in doing so but it works, so I figured

                <pre>
                    [Verse 1]
                    On a dark desert highway
                    Cool wind in my hair
                    Warm smell of colitas
                    Rising up through the air
                    Up ahead in the distance
                    I saw a shimmering light
                    My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
                    I had to stop for the night

                    [Verse 2]
                    There she stood in the doorway
                    I heard the mission bell
                    And I was thinkin' to myself
                    "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
                    Then she lit up a candle
                    And she showed me the way
                    There were voices down the corridor
                    I thought I heard them say

                    [Chorus]
                    "Welcome to the Hotel California
                    Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
                    Such a lovely face
                    Plenty of room at the Hotel California
                    Any time of year (Any time of year)
                    You can find it here"

                    [Verse 3]
                    Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
                    She got the Mercedes Benz, uh
                    She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
                    That she calls friends
                    How they dance in the courtyard
                    Sweet summer sweat
                    Some dance to remember
                    Some dance to forget

                    [Verse 4]
                    So I called up the Captain
                    "Please bring me my wine"
                    He said, "We haven't had that spirit here
                    Since 1969"
                    And still those voices are callin'
                    From far away
                    Wake you up in the middle of the night
                    Just to hear them say

                    [Chorus]
                    "Welcome to the Hotel California
                    Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
                    Such a lovely face
                    They livin' it up at the Hotel California
                    What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
                    Bring your alibis"

                    [Verse 5]
                    Mirrors on the ceiling
                    The pink champagne on ice, and she said
                    "We are all just prisoners here
                    Of our own device"
                    And in the master's chambers
                    They gathered for the feast
                    They stab it with their steely knives
                    But they just can't kill the beast

                    [Verse 6]
                    Last thing I remember, I was
                    Running for the door
                    I had to find the passage back
                    To the place I was before
                    "Relax," said the night man
                    "We are programmed to receive
                    You can check out any time you like
                    But you can never leave"
